Client extension for [Presence](https:/github.com/volskaya/presence).

Extension sends active buffers path to the server, on first inserted character,
after focusing window or changing active buffer.

Presence then tracks the commits inside git and updates Discord's Rich Presence
with something like "Working on Presence, Ahead by 3 commits"

###### Work in progress
